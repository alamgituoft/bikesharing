# Summary 
Overall the data shows that citibike is extremely popular in NYC with almost 2 million subscribing customers and 450,000 one-time usage customers. The customer profile is more dominent with male customers with bikes used mostly during peak working hours during the weak. The data also suggest popular usage during weekends which could be used leisurely by subcribers and customers visiting NYC as a transport method around the city. The data suggests that Citibike has potential to expand in Des Moines due to it's popularity in NYC.

* One suggestion for future visualizations is to look at usage for the full year instead of just August. This should show how bike usage is outside of summer months. 
* Another suggestion would be to look at whether the data can be dissected to review customer profiles and usage such as building visualizations to show how often subcribers and other customers are using bikes per month.
